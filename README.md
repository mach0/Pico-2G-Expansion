# Pico-2G-Expansion

Raspberry Pi Pico 2G Expansion is a QUAD-Band GSM/GPRS/GNSS Expansion designed dedicatedly for Raspberry Pi Pico with UART, USB 2.0 Interface, 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, Bluetooth 3.0 based on SIM868 module to perform easy and efficient communication. Pico 2G Expansion works on the embedded TCP/UDP Protocols with Multi-constellation GNSS receiver support.

Pico 2G Expansion also includes a 1.14-inch display with a resolution of 240 x 135 pixels, 65K RGB colors, and a sharp and vivid exhibiting effect, designed primarily for user engagement via SPI connection by incorporating a GPIO header. The 1.14-inch LCD includes the ST7789 Driver and SPI Interface, decreasing the amount of IO pins required.
